*PowerApp: How to clear text input fields?*

There are several ways to clear text input fields in PowerApps. One way is to use the Reset function on a button, which will clear the text input and show the default value or hint text1. Another way is to use the Clear field option in the properties of the text input, which will display an “X” when the field is in focus and allow the user to clear the field by clicking on it2.

You can also clear the text input using context variables. Set the Default property of the text box to a variable and use the UpdateContext function on the OnSelect property of the submit button1. You can also set the Default property to a value that will reset the input, such as an empty string1. Finally, you can create a variable and use it in the Reset property of the text input, and then update the variable using the UpdateContext function1.
